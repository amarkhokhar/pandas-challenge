# pandas-challenge
Repo for the pandas challenge for bootcamp

This repository hold a jupyter notebook called PyCitySchools that analyzes the school and student attributes of the csv files in the resources folder, which are students_complete.csv and schools_complete.csv. 

This jupyter files utilizes pandas functions and DataFrames that will analyze the merged csv files and provide statistics and conclusions on the schools, districts, and students within the data. 

Two major sources of help were AskBCS and Stackoverflow because I needed help formatting the output of the school_type variable to remove brackets from either the charter or district output. Additionally, drop_duplicates() was used to drop any duplicate values in the data in order to perform analysis.
